# Exercise 2.1: Setup Continuous Integration

In this exercise, you will set up a *Continuous Integration* (CI) workflow using GitHub as a version control system, Travis CI as a build tool, and DockerHub as artifact repository manager. This workflow will execute the unit tests of the source code and build the code. To trigger it, a change of the codebase has to be performed.

1. Add and commit `main.go` and `main_test.go` to your repository via drag-and-drop.

1. Active Travis CI for your GitHub repository.

    * Follow instructions on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci

1. Create file `.travis.yml` in your repository and copy-paste content from provided `.travis.yml` file. 

1. Trigger a Travis build by a code change, e.g., change "Hello" to "Hi there" in the file `./main.go`

1. Watch Travis executing your tests and building the artifact.
